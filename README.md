# Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains the code and results for predicting diabetes in patients based on the `diabetes.csv` dataset. The project includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the implementation of various classification models.

## Overview

Diabetes is a prevalent health condition, and predicting its occurrence is crucial for early intervention and management. This project focuses on exploring the `diabetes.csv` dataset and building classification models to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project, `diabetes.csv`, is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning for diabetes prediction. It includes various health-related features that can be used to train predictive models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is a critical step in understanding the characteristics of the dataset. Key insights and visualizations were obtained during the EDA process, providing a foundation for subsequent machine learning tasks.

## Classification Models

Different classification models were implemented to predict the occurrence of diabetes in patients. The models were trained, validated, and evaluated to assess their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

### List of Classification Models Explored

- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
